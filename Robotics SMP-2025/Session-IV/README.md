## Fire and Smoke Detection Model Training

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`FireSmokeDetectionModelTraining.ipynb`) that demonstrates the process of downloading a fire and smoke detection dataset, training a YOLOv8 model, and performing inference.

### 1\. Dataset Download using Roboflow

The dataset for training the YOLO model is efficiently downloaded and prepared using the Roboflow Python SDK.

#### What this notebook does for dataset download:

  * Authenticates with your Roboflow account using an API key.
  * Fetches the **Fire Detection v3** project (version 6) from the `touatimed2` workspace.
  * Downloads the dataset in **YOLOv5 format**, which is also compatible with **Ultralytics YOLOv8**.

Roboflow simplifies dataset management, labeling, versioning, and formatting for many popular ML frameworks, including YOLO.

### 3\. Model Training

The notebook initializes a YOLOv8n model and trains it for fire and smoke detection. The model is trained on a dataset with 2 classes (fire and smoke).


### 4\. Inference

The notebook also contains code to perform inference using the trained model on video data.

### 5\. Technologies Used

The notebook utilizes the following Python libraries:

  * `roboflow`
  * `ultralytics`
  * `torch`
  * `os`
  * `pathlib`

### 6\. Setup and Usage

To run this Jupyter notebook:

1.  **Clone the repository** (if this notebook is part of a larger GitHub repository).
2.  **Install necessary libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install roboflow ultralytics torch
    ```
    Ensure you have the correct PyTorch version that supports your CUDA (GPU) setup if you plan to use a GPU.
3.  **Obtain a Roboflow API key**: You will need a Roboflow API key to download the dataset. Replace it in the notebook with your actual API key.

5.  **Run cells sequentially** to download the dataset, load the model, train it, and perform inference.
